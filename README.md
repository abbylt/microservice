USDA ARMS Data Fetch is a simple microservice that fetches survey data from the USDA ARMS API. It is designed to specifically integrate into my partner's application, a data visualization app for agricultural data. The microservice will return streamlined data that will be used to populate the filters available to the user as well as the actual data displayed in the dashboard.
